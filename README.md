## Project setup

### Prerequisites
create a new app in your local machine
* I have added the following scripts in the package json ( start": "PORT=8000 react-scripts start", "server": "json-server --watch db.json -p 8001"and )

* To run the backend *run npm install 
* run server
 * Test your server by visiting this route in the browser: http://localhost:8001/bots 
 * In a different terminal * run npm start (start :Port 8000)

### projectDeliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

See profiles of all bots rendered in BotCollection. Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should render in the YourBotArmy component. The bot can be enlisted only once. The bot does not disappear from the BotCollection. Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the YourBotArmy component. Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the YourBotArmy on the frontend.

### Advanced Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

Choose if I want to enlist a bot into my army or just see their data. Clicking on the card should instead display a show view (BotSpecs) for that bot, which should replace BotsCollection. BotSpecs should have two buttons: one to go back to the list view and another to enlist that bot. Your app could look like the following:
